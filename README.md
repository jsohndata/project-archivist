# Project: Archivist
This is a Bootstrap 5 sidebar (vertical menu) template I have created for a documentation site. 

• Toggle: Close sidebar, still requires polishing
• Menu: For mobile I use dropdown menu, otherwise use collapse. I think collapse works better on desktop when there are pelthora of items. Dropdown menu however, works best IMO on mobile.
